WHY WE NEED HEADER TAG
The <header> element is one of several new semantic document tags introduced with HTML5. It is used to define a header section for the element that contains it. It can be used as a header for a whole page (the most common usage), but can also be used as the header for an article or any other piece of on-page content.
Typically, when the <header> element is used as a page header, it contains the site’s title or logo (or both) and the main site navigation. This is sometimes known as the “masthead”.
